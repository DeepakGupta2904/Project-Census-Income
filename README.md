I am done this project as a Data Scientist Intern at Intellipaat Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd.

In this project, I am going to work on the Census Income dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that contains the income information for over 48,000 individuals taken from the 1994 US census. For more details about this dataset, you can refer to the following link:- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income

Tasks To Be Performed:-
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to find key insights.
2. Use various machine learning algorithms to predict the response variable.
